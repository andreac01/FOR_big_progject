### Comprehensive Project for the Foundations of Operations Research Course at Politecnico di Milano

This project encompasses the development of a Python notebook dedicated to implementing a streamlined linear programming algorithm. The primary objective is to devise a method that, with computational efficiency, determines the optimal selection of charging stations to activate along a cycling route. The selection aims to minimize the maximum distance between any two consecutively active stations, all while adhering to a predefined budget constraint.
